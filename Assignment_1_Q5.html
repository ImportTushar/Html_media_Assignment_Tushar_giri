    <p>In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language),
        <br>
    a DOCTYPE declaration, often referred to as a DOCTYPE,
    <br>
    it is an instruction that specifies the version of HTML in which a web page is written. 
    <br>
    It helps web browsers and other user agents to interpret and render the web page correctly, 
    <br>
    as different versions of HTML may have different rules and features.
    <br>
    A typical DOCTYPE declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, 
    <br>
    usually right before the opening < html > tag. 
    <br>
    It consists of the < !DOCTYPE> element followed by the document type definition.</p>
